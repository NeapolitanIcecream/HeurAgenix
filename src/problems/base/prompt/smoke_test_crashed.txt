To verify whether the code is correct, we conducted a smoke test.
This is the test data:
{smoke_instance_problem_state}

While executing {function_name} with the given dataset, the program encountered an error and crashed. The following error message was displayed:
{error_message}

Please try to fix it.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
1. If you think this heuristic can not be implemented, respond to me ***python_code:None*** and we will stop this generation.
2. If you can fix up this issues, please respond to me in this format:
***python_code:
from {components_file} import *
import other_library (if necessary)
def {function_name}(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
    """ Description for this heuristic algorithm.

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state.. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            - necessary_key (value type): description
            ...
        (Optional and can be omitted if no algorithm data) algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:

        (Optional and can be omitted if no hyper parameters data) introduction for hyper parameters in kwargs if used.

    Returns:
