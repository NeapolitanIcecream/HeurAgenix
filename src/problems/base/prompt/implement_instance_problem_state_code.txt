Try to implement the get_instance_problem_state function in python:
def get_instance_problem_state(instance_data: dict) -> dict:

The input is instance_data
{instance_data_introduction}

The output is algo a dict, which contains the following problem states as keys: {instance_problem_states}.

Please note:
1. Never modify the instance_data.
2. The name of function must be get_instance_problem_state.
3. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
4. Comments in the code are very important.


The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***python_code:
import library (if necessary)
def get_instance_problem_state(instance_data: dict) -> dict:
    """Extract instance problem state from instance data.

    Args:
        instance_data (dict): The dictionary contains the instance data.

    Returns:
        dict: The dictionary contains the instance problem state with:
            - problem_state_name (type): description
            - problem_state_name (type): description
            ...
    """
