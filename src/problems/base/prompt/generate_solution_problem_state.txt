Now, we aim to collaboratively create the functions to generate some problem states(statistics data), which captures the high-level features of current (partial) solution for the {problem}.

These functions will be underpinned by rigorous statistical analysis and domain-specific knowledge, ensuring they are both accurate and relevant.


In determining the optimal problem states to represent instance, we must adhere to the following criteria:
1. The data representation should be succinct to minimize computational load while retaining sufficient granularity to recognize the solution feature.
2. It must incorporate unique attributes that aid in the clear distinction between different solution stage.
3. We need to evaluate the current status from multiple dimensions, including the current progress of the solution, the quality of the solution, the status of the remaining data, etc.
4. The most important, these data relates to both instance and current solution, and will update during the problem solving process.

Now, please tell me which statistical data are best serve as solution problem state.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***solution_problem_state:
problem_state_name;how_to_calculate;reason
problem_state_name;how_to_calculate;reason
....
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
