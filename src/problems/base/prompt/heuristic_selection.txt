We have already implement the following heuristics.
These are the heuristics in format: heuristic_name(parameter=default_value, ..): introduction
{heuristic_pool_introduction}


The global data with some heuristic values for this problem:
{global_data_feature}
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

The state data some heuristic values for current stage:
{state_data_feature}
Note: Some data are omitted due to space constraints.

We want to switch heuristics in real time to solve the problem. Each selected heuristic will be executed {selection_frequency} steps.

Before this discuss, we have already {discuss_round} rounds discuss and the most recent discussion is as follows:
{heuristic_traject}

Now we hope to select heuristic for next {selection_frequency} steps.

Please select {num_candidate_heuristics} heuristics as candidate heuristic for current state and put the one you think is most reasonable first.


The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
