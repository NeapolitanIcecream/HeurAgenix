We aim to collaboratively create the functions to generate some problem states(statistics data), which captures the high-level features of problem instance for the {problem}. 

These functions will be underpinned by rigorous statistical analysis and domain-specific knowledge, ensuring they are both accurate and relevant.


In determining the optimal problem states to represent instance, we must adhere to the following criteria:
1. The data representation should be succinct to minimize computational load while retaining sufficient granularity to recognize the feature of the problem and solution.
2. It must incorporate unique attributes that aid in the clear distinction between different instances.
3. The most important, these data only focus on instance and has nothing to do with solution.

Now, please tell me which statistical data are best serve as instance problem state.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***instance_problem_state:
problem_state_name;how_to_calculate;reason
problem_state_name;how_to_calculate;reason
....
***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
