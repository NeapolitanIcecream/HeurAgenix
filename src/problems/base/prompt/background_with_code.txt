I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on {problem} problem:
{problem_description}

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
{solution_class}
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms.Â 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
{operator_class}

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
{problem_state_introduction}
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Please consider is {problem} a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?
If you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***is_cop:yes/no***
Ensure there is no other content inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
